# Bootstrap Portfolio Project

The purpose of this project was to build my portfolio using Bootstrap to improve my skills on it, plus to make it look better through easy to use templates from the Bootstrap documentation. It's other purpose is to show off my skills to potential employers. I learned a huge amount about Bootstrap and how it's really easy to use.
